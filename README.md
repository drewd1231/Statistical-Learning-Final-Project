This project explains how a generalized additive model works in R by modeling men's NESCAC cross country personal records using their respective track results. The xc_final_project.md file contains the html output of the raw xc_final_project.Rmd file. The xc_clean.csv contains the data I scraped from tfrrs.org to use in the model. Finally, the folder contains the pngs of the graphics produced in the html file.
